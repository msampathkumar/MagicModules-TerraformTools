# Magic Modules - Terraform Automation Tools

The Magic Modules Terraform Automation Tools (`tftools`) are utilities written in Python3 for Terraform developers who want to develop and test Terraform snippets in [Magic Modules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules).

As input, the script takes a `filename.tf` and outputs `filename.tf.erb` plus `terraform.yaml` content. The tool lets you do the reverse as well.
